# Lab07 - Stand up

## Yesterday

I worked on the prototype for the frontend for the application. I have submitted it to the client for review.

## Future 

I plan to begin the front end development and do what doesn't require the clients feedbacks, such as setting up to e framework and implementing the basic layout.

## Blockers

I am waiting on the client review before I can fully begin the development of the frontend. Potential future blocker is also waiting for the backend API to finish the frontend.
